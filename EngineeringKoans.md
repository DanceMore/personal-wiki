## engineering koans

passed amongst engineers and SREs as a Buddhist like way of sharing wisdom succinctly.

```
0. shipping is a feature

1. perfect is the enemy of good

alternatively: don't let perfection get in the way of good enough

2. simple things should be easy; difficult things should be possible.

3. code exists for humans to read and machines to run.

4. "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

alternatively: "Keep it simple, stupid!"

n: sometimes, total complexity in your system cannot be reduced, it can only be re-arranged. however, proper ordering of the complexity can still reduce your pain.
